Question 1

1. Both div's will have a background colour of green.
2.    #firstDiv {
        background: pink;
    }
3.   .yellow-card, #secondDiv {
        background: yellow;
    }



Question 2

1. The function can be parsed correctly  because X was declared within the function.
2. Stricter syntax can be introduced to viriable by using: "use strict"; eg.
fuction legal(x){
  "use strict";
  console.log(x);
  var x;
}

or 

"use strict";
fuction legal(x){
  console.log(x);
  var x;
}
